### About my corpus
As an international student from South Korea, my passion for K-pop extends beyond the contemporary music of my time to include that of the preceding millennium. Over the years, I have observed the transformative changes in K-pop, influenced by advancements in production techniques and the forces of globalization. Notably, the growing collaborations between K-pop and Western artists have resulted in a fusion of diverse musical genres. In particular, I anticipate “Millennium K-pop” and “K-pop ON!” playlists to reveal distinct differences in musical components, including the tempo and rhythm, instrumentation trends, and melodic content. Upon reviewing the Spotify-curated playlists, I can conclude that both collections feature tracks that defined their respective eras. It is also important to acknowledge that both playlists maintain consistency by exclusively featuring music from K-pop groups without incorporating other genres like K-hip-hop or K-indie. However, a notable difference lies in the playlist sizes; the “Millennium K-pop” playlist consists of 100 tracks, while “K-pop ON!” features 50 tracks. For the analysis to have a more balanced comparison, it would be beneficial to augment the tracks from the millennium. In conclusion, my objective is to enhance my understanding of how K-pop has evolved by comparing the two playlists on Spotify, each representing different temporal frames - the millennium and the present.

### Do more people listen to K-pop now than before?
```{r}
kpop_mill <- get_playlist_audio_features("", "37i9dQZF1DWUoY6Ih7vsxr")
kpop_on <- get_playlist_audio_features("", "1y6ywhJxaBAjAQ6Ybmg0kg")
```

```{r}
kpop <-
  bind_rows(
    kpop_mill |> mutate(category = "Millennium"),
    kpop_on |> mutate(category = "ON!")
  )
```

```{r}
ggplot1 <- ggplot(kpop, aes(
  x = tempo, y = danceability, color = track.popularity)) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_continuous(name = "Popularity", trans = "reverse") + 
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Tempo and Danceability: K-pop Millennium vs. K-pop ON!", x = "Tempo", y = "Danceability") + 
  facet_grid(. ~ playlist_name, scales = "fixed")

ggplotly(ggplot1)
```

***
In exploring the relationship between danceability and tempo within the playlists "K-pop ON!" and "Millennium K-pop," it is evident that while no strong correlation exists between the two variables, danceability tends to increase with higher tempo. Additionally, the color-coded points on the scatter plot reveal that current K-pop tracks exhibit significantly higher popularity compared to tracks in the Millennium playlist. However, the correlation between track popularity and danceability remains unclear, as no definitive relationship has been established.

### Is there a noteable difference in the distribution of tempo and danceability between the two playlists?
```{r}
tempo <- ggplot(kpop, aes(
  x = tempo)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Tempo", x = "Tempo") + 
  facet_grid(. ~ playlist_name, scales = "fixed")
```

```{r}
danceability <- ggplot(kpop, aes(
  x = danceability)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.030) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Danceability", x = "Danceability") + 
  facet_grid(. ~ playlist_name, scales = "fixed")
```

```{r}
grid.arrange(tempo, danceability, ncol=2)
```

***
For a more detailed comparison between the two playlists, histograms were created to visualize the distribution of danceability and tempo. While danceability values remain relatively similar between the two playlists, there is a notable shift in tempo. In the Millennium playlist, there is a distinct preference for a specific tempo, whereas contemporary tracks display a more diverse range, resembling a more symmetrical distribution.
