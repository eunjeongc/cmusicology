# Computational Musicology

## Description of corpus
As an international student from South Korea, my passion for K-pop extends beyond the contemporary music of my time to include that of the preceding millennium. Over the years, I have observed the transformative changes in K-pop, influenced by advancements in production techniques and the forces of globalization. Notably, the growing collaborations between K-pop and Western artists have resulted in a fusion of diverse musical genres. In particular, I anticipate “Millennium K-pop” and “K-pop ON!” playlists to reveal distinct differences in musical components, including the tempo and rhythm, instrumentation trends, and melodic content. Upon reviewing the Spotify-curated playlists, I can conclude that both collections feature tracks that defined their respective eras. It is also important to acknowledge that both playlists maintain consistency by exclusively featuring music from K-pop groups without incorporating other genres like K-hip-hop or K-indie. However, a notable difference lies in the playlist sizes; the “Millennium K-pop” playlist consists of 100 tracks, while “K-pop ON!” features 50 tracks. For the analysis to have a more balanced comparison, it would be beneficial to augment the tracks from the millennium. In conclusion, my objective is to enhance my understanding of how K-pop has evolved by comparing the two playlists on Spotify, each representing different temporal frames - the millennium and the present.

## Initial exploration of the corpus 
![tempo vs dance](https://github.com/eunjeongc/cmusicology/assets/126684614/7c71f653-df72-4ab1-9d20-5c87faec62c1)

In exploring the relationship between danceability and tempo within the playlists "K-pop ON!" and "Millennium K-pop," it is evident that while no strong correlation exists between the two variables, danceability tends to increase with higher tempo. Additionally, the color-coded points on the scatter plot reveal that current K-pop tracks exhibit significantly higher popularity compared to tracks in the Millennium playlist.

For a more detailed comparison between the two playlists, histograms were created to visualize the distribution of danceability and tempo. While danceability values remain relatively similar between the two playlists, there is a notable shift in tempo. In the Millennium playlist, there is a distinct preference for a specific tempo, whereas contemporary tracks display a more diverse range, resembling a normal distribution.
