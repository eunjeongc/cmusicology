# Computational Musicology

##Description of corpus
As an international student from South Korea, my passion for K-pop extends beyond the contemporary music of my time to include that of the preceding millennium. Over the years, I have observed the transformative changes in K-pop, influenced by advancements in production techniques and the forces of globalization. Notably, the growing collaborations between K-pop and Western artists have resulted in a fusion of diverse musical genres. In particular, I anticipate “Millennium K-pop” and “K-pop ON!” playlists to reveal distinct differences in musical components, including the tempo and rhythm, instrumentation trends, and melodic content. Upon reviewing the Spotify-curated playlists, I can conclude that both collections feature tracks that defined their respective eras. It is also important to acknowledge that both playlists maintain consistency by exclusively featuring music from K-pop groups without incorporating other genres like K-hip-hop or K-indie. However, a notable difference lies in the playlist sizes; the “Millennium K-pop” playlist consists of 100 tracks, while “K-pop ON!” features 50 tracks. For the analysis to have a more balanced comparison, it would be beneficial to augment the tracks from the millennium. In conclusion, my objective is to enhance my understanding of how K-pop has evolved by comparing the two playlists on Spotify, each representing different temporal frames - the millennium and the present.
